Select one .XYZ files using the browsing button, the selected file will be used as input files for the generation of a database of clusters with sampled distances.

Select the sampling option One/All. If one is found, inter-atomic distances will be sampled by using one sampling step (in the range 0.3รท96.0 A), derived according to the specified wavelength and 2theta maximum values supplied in the next line.
If all is found, all sampling steps will be used, producing 32 sets of sampled distances.

Enter the wavelength and 2theta maximum values using the corresponding text fields. Units are Angstroem and degrees, respectively.
