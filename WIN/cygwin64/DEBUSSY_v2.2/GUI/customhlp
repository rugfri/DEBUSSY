For a 'XY-plot' select the corresponding button at the top left corner of the custom pltting window.
Select the file to plot either entering the name (with path if necessary) or using the 'Browse' button;
Enter the column number for the x-axis in the field 'x', this will be 'xj' variable, where 'j' is the line number in the plotting window;
Enter the column number for the y-axis in the field 'y', this will be 'yj' variable, where 'j' is the line number in the plotting window;
This is enough to obtain a plot.
Optionally:
- the secondary y-axis can be enabled entering the column number in the field 'z',  this will be 'zj' variable, where 'j' is the line number in the plotting window;
- use the field 'Transform' to perform some operation on the colums, for example, to make a Int. vs Q plot on the first line type:
4*pi*sin(radians(x1/2))/<yourlambda>,y1 or Q(x1,<yourlambda>),y1 (since a function Q and q=(Q/(2*pi)) has been defined); to plot the difference (y2-y1) vs x2 type: x2,y2-y1; it is also possible to use the notation fj[k] to identify a column, where 'j' is the file (i.e. line number) and 'k' the column number within the file.
- use the 'Options' field to customise the colour, marker and label according to the matplotlib syntax, for example to use a red line type: 'r-', or to use a label: label='<your label>', or both: 'r-', label='<your label>';
- to modify the range on one of the axes use the corrensponding field entering the lower and upper limits sepatared by a blank space, e.g.: 10.1 50.5
- for the labels on one of the axes enter the text in the corresponding field, for mathematical symbols use TeX-like syntax enclosing them within $-sign, e.g. 2$\theta$
- and so on...

For a 2D-map
Use the 'File', 'x', 'y' and 'z' to define the file, the x- and y-axis and the intensity scale, respectively.
The 'Transform' field can be used to perform some opertations with the columns, e.g., w.r.t. the syntax described above: f1[8],f1[9],f1[4]-f2[4] will produce a map using the 8th coulmn of the first file as x-axis, the 9th column of the first file as y-axis and the difference between the 4th columns of the first and second file as intensity scale.
The 'Options' field is disabled.
With the 'map threshold' field it is possible to apply a threshold on the intensity scale, calculated along the specified axis, e.
g. typing: f1[4] 0.01, only the values of the map having a value greater than 0.01 in the 4th column of the specified file will be plotted.
